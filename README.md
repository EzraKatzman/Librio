### TODO:
- Dark mode
- Companion scanner app
- *Abstraction*
- Toast notifications
    - For adding book

- Keyboard shortcuts
    - Ctrl + A -> add book
    - Ctrl + E -> edit book (when book selected)

### Bugs:
- Book modal keeps last clicked status even if not saved - should revert to stored info on open
    
### Longer Term:
- User profiles + login
- Migrate to postgres
